# musicbee-tabletTM
A Theatre Mode skin optimized for an 8-10" device


I have a 10" Windows 10 Tablet on my wall running MusicBee, but it was fiddly to control.
This TM shows the current album art and 4 upcoming albums, has track skip buttons, an album skip button, play/pause and mute, with a clock at the top for functionality and a progress bar along the bottom.

Jaguar font used for the clock and Lemon Milk for the song details
