I have a 10" Windows 10 Tablet on my wall running MusicBee, but it was fiddly to control.
This TM shows the current album art and 4 upcoming albums, has track skip buttons, an album skip button, play/pause and mute, with a clock at the top for functionality

Jaguar font used for the clock and Lemon Milk for the song details
